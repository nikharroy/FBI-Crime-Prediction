        "In order to investigate how crime trends have changed over time in the US, this project will analyze FBI crime statistics. In order to promote greater awareness and planning, the primary goal was to learn more about trends in criminal incidences and pinpoint times of high or low activity.Monthly and annual records of various crime types are included in the collection. To ensure reliable analysis, it was first cleaned to address missing numbers and discrepancies. Important patterns and seasonal trends were found using exploratory data analysis and visualizations such as line charts and bar plots. For instance, it was discovered that some crimes peaked in particular months, while others exhibited steady increases or decreases over time.The analysis provided valuable insights into how crime varies by time and location, which can be helpful for law enforcement agencies, researchers, and policymakers. It also lays the foundation for future work, such as forecasting crime trends or developing targeted crime prevention strategies based on historical behavior.\n",
